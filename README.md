# panos-conf

PAN-OS configuration utility.

Currently let's you fetch all "Objects" on one or more PANOS devices, and store
them as YAML files. Useful for automating existing PANOS devices.

### Current roadmap:
* Fetch other configuration aspects of PANOS devices, such as:
  - "Device" configuration
  - "Network" configuration
  - "Policies" configuration
* Push configuration to PANOS devices based on YAML
* Push files to PANOS devices (certificates, etc)

### Potential future roadmap:
* Configure Panorama
* Configure HA
